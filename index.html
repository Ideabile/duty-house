                Whetever is about the laundry, cooking or homeworks.<br/>
                Is important to <b>get things done</b>, but what about <b>rewards</b>?

                We want to keep stuff simple, and we build on top of <a href="https://www.google.com/sheets/about/">spreadsheet</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                For this reasons we trust you to understand soft rules rather of enforcing with a fancy role base system.<br/>

                Is not about <b>winning</b>, is about <b>achieving</b>.

                We build on top of Google Api and we don't store any of your data.
            </p>
            <p>
                The data is yours... and Google's 🙃
            </p>
            <p>
                You can already use the build-in Google Spreadsheet sharing options so you can:
                <ul>
                    <li>Keep the spreadsheet private for your self and your family</li>
                    <li>Make the spreadsheet public and give edit options to who you trust</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                If Google is a no-go for you, we're sorry we currently don't have a solution for your case.<br/>
